:toc: preamble
:toc-title: Table of contents

This application will do in the future following transformations:

1. Writes records to Kafka in JSON format
JSON example:

{
"name": "John",
"surname": "Doe",
"cats": 1,
"dogs": 2
}

1. Reads the data from the topic
1. Parses the JSONs
1. Surname to upper case letters
1. Sum cats and dogs fields and write the result to the new field “animals”.
1. The result should be written as a parquet file in which every record consists of 3 columns: name (String), surname (String), animals (Integer).
